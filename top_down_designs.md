"getting food at a restaurant"
Assumptions:

1. Getting food from a "traditional" sit down restaurant that has a host stand and table service (i.e. NOT a fast casual or fast food restaurant).
1. Getting to the restaurant is outside of the scope.
1. Task stops after food is received since the instruction does not address paying for food, leaving restaurant, etc.
