"getting food at a restaurant"

##### Assumptions:
1. Getting food from a "traditional" sit down restaurant that has a host and table service (i.e. _NOT_ a fast casual or fast food restaurant).
11. Getting to the restaurant is outside of the scope.
111. Task stops after food is received since the premise does not address paying for food, leaving restaurant, etc.

    1. Approach restaurant host
    2. Talk to restaurant host to either
      1. Tell them you've arrived and have a reservation OR
      2. Tell them you've arrived and don't have a reservation
    2. Wait for host instructions
    2. Follow host to table
    2. Judge correct distance to pull chair away from table so you have room to be comfortably seated
    2. Sit in chair and adjust distance to table to comfort
  3. Decide what food you would like to eat
    1. Talk until server has asked if you're ready to order, then say "Shoot actually can you come back in another minute?"

    1. Where's the server?
